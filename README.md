# React Todo App

This is a simple to Todo App written in React. I got the server.rb file from Facebook so that you can run this app through a server. It has simple functions of adding a task and deleting a task as done.

### To run:

clone the repo then,

```sh
ruby server.rb
```
And visit <http://localhost:3000/>

### How to contribute:
feel free to create a pull request if you want to add more functions or change the design. Make sure to create your own branch.

I plan to add  a 'complete' tab in the future wherein if clicked it will show all the items that were marked done.
