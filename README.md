# React Todo App

This is a simple to Todo App written in React. I decided to study React for my project in Dev Bootcamp. We had a total of 4 days to finish a very simple and functional app. I believe I was able to grasp the basic concepts of React. I have a lot more of studying to do to be more comfortable with it since it is a powerful tool to use with very complex web apps.

I got the server.rb file from Facebook so that you can run this app through a server. It has simple functions of adding a task and deleting a task as done.

### To run:

clone the repo then on your terminal run,

```sh
ruby server.rb
```
And visit <http://localhost:3000/>

### How to contribute:
feel free to create a pull request if you want to add more functions or change the design. Make sure to create your own branch.

I plan to add the following things in the future:
 1. a 'complete' tab in the future wherein if clicked it will show all the items that were marked done.
 2. have a check box beside every task which toggles
 3. if checked, sets the task to be color green
